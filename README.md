My Object Oriented experience
===============================================

This repository holds the code from  [Object Oriented](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/oo)
course from KnpUniversity. It's a great opportunity to refresh all concepts about OO and enjoy
the coding. Thanks to KnpU folks.
